                <h2>Meditation </h2>
                <h3>1. Yogurt</h3>

                <p>A research conducted by UCLA demonstrated that probiotic yogurt is able to change the gut bacteria, which helps strengthen one’s immunity and lower one’s blood pressure. Yogurt can also improve the way our brains work, deepening concentration which is critical for mediation. Even frozen yogurt works wonders.</p>
                <h3><br><br><br>2. Tea</h3>
                <img src="https://spoonuniversity.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/61/2015/02/tea-1024x680.jpg">
                <p>The origins of meditation come from China, and tea is historically linked to activity. Unlike milk which facilitates your sleep, tea keeps you awake thanks to caffeine. Tea is a good choice in keeping yourself alert. The caffeine plays a role in calming your nerves and helps you concentrate, leading one to be more efficient in striving for mindfulness.</p>
                <h3><br><br><br><br><br>3. Milk</h3>
                <img src="https://spoonuniversity.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/61/2015/01/DSC_0076-2-1024x703.jpg">
                <p>The fact that milk is good for our body seems to be common sense. Milk contains plenty of potassium, which has been shown to offset the muscle spasms when a person feels tense. Full of Vitamin B2 and B12, milk helps you sleep and get a good night’s rest, which is important for everything involving the brain. Chocolate milk works too!</p>
                <h3><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>4. Nuts</h3>
                <img src="https://spoonuniversity.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/61/2015/02/DSC_0206-2-1024x680.jpg">
                <p>Full of antioxidant Vitamin E and zinc, nuts such as almonds, pistachios and walnuts are good for boosting the immune system. They also contain plenty of B-Vitamins, which help you manage stress and depression. Researchers have shown that nuts improve the function of our brains to solve problems, yet another important part of meditation.</p>

                <h2>Stress</h2>
                <h3>1. Avocado</h3>
                <img src="https://www.health.com/thmb/qrUQ-GppFhESp7yVJ_OWmF-LJgw=/750x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/GettyImages-1210634323-ed2bb564aa1e4239b23f468d78d17296.jpg">
                <p>Consuming regular portions of avocado might help with anxiety due to its vitamin B content. Research has linked B-vitamin-rich foods to reduced symptoms and lower feelings of anxiety.

                    One medium avocado has several B vitamins,
                    <ol>
                    <li>Folate (B9)</li>
                    <li>Niacin (B3)</li>
                    <li>Pantothenic acid (B5)</li>
                    <li>Riboflavin (B2)</li>
                    <li>Vitamin (B6)</li></ol></p>
                <h3>2. Blueberries</h3>
                <img src="https://www.health.com/thmb/bvjUNZfE6J1sqDaO7b1q2L7Ug1o=/750x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/GettyImages-529677122-0107703e5b564d0897192ee61dc1d4d2.jpg">
                <p>Eating blueberries could be helpful for stress. Blueberries are rich in antioxidants, which help delay and prevent cell damage.A study published in 2019 found that, in postmenopausal people, increased dietary antioxidants lowered anxiety scores.</p>
                <h3><br><br><br><br><br><br>3. Calcium-Rich Foods</h3>
                <img src="https://www.health.com/thmb/w0XOa3fhbjpSc5a0QwsUOyVQlRE=/750x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/GettyImages-495950860-a5681105cc234a92837c9e4a60a48da7.jpg">
                <p>A study published in 2022 found that increasing your calcium intake may be helpful for your mood.Calcium-rich foods include dairy products like milk and yogurt and vegetables like spinach and kale.<br>

                    The researchers received data from 1,233 college students and found that those who ate more dairy and calcium were less stressed than others. They also noted that increased calcium intake often resulted in less anxious feelings and more resilience.</p>
                <h3><br><br><br><br><br>4. Eggs</h3>
                <img src="https://www.health.com/thmb/3xKgSdOEGhAan6HsScUxU0TN4MM=/750x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/GettyImages-989213926-7b7d24dc52d1455aba6aad67b6b73651.jpg">
                <p>Research has linked zinc deficiency to anxiety. A 1-ounce portion of raw cashews has 1.6 milligrams of zinc, which is about 14% to 20% of the recommended amount of zinc for adults.

                    Some evidence suggests that magnesium also helps improve mood and anxiety symptoms. Chia seeds and pumpkin seeds are sources of magnesium</p>

                <h2>Sleep</h2>
                <h3>1. Cherry Juice</h3>
                <img src="https://ahbeard.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/branch-plant-fruit-berry-leaf-flower-591932-pxhere.com_-1080x715.jpg">
                <p>In a 2018 study by the American Journal of Therapeutics found cherries to help increase sleep quality and duration in both women and men. Keep cherry juice in your fridge, for a refreshing bedtime drink.</p>
                <h3><br><br><br><br><br>2. Poultry</h3>
                <img src="https://imgs.search.brave.com/olLU0q-LakLh7ZGtXRROL3WqOGqvTB212F1h9NLfrvs/rs:fit:860:0:0/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly9oaXBz/LmhlYXJzdGFwcHMu/Y29tL2htZy1wcm9k/L2ltYWdlcy90dXJr/ZXktNjU1N2M4MzRh/ZjdlNS5qcGc_Y3Jv/cD0xLjAweHc6MC42/Njl4aDswLDAuMjI4/eGgmcmVzaXplPTM2/MDoq">
                <p>This proves to hold some truth, as poultry such as turkey and chicken is high in tryptophan. If you’re feeling hungry before bedtime, nibble on a piece of lean chicken breast, or put a slice of turkey on a piece of whole-grain bread for a strategic, before-bed snack.</p>
                <h3>3. Beans</h3>
                <img src="https://ahbeard.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/iStock-899494024-1080x1332.jpg">
                <p>Beans contain a nice little combination of B vitamins like B6, niacin, and folate, which help the brain in many ways. B vitamins have long been used to treat insomnia, and helps to alleviate stress and anxiety.</p>
                <h3>4. Yoghurt</h3>
                <img src="https://ahbeard.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/fruit-sweet-morning-glass-cup-meal-915806-pxhere.com_-1080x722.jpg">
                <p>Yoghurt contains calcium, which is needed for processing sleep-inducing hormone melatonin. What’s more, it’s a delicious alternative to ice cream (for those among us with a sweet tooth).</p>
